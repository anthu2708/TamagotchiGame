# Virtual Pet Game

## Project Description

This application will **simulate a virtual pet** (Tamagotchi) that the user must take care of by feeding it, playing with it, and keeping it happy. Over time, the pet will have various needs, and if left unmet, it can become ill or even die. The user will be able to interact with the pet through commands and see its current health status.

## Who Will Use It?

This application will be used by anyone who enjoys virtual pets and wants a simple, nostalgic game that involves nurturing and caring for a virtual companion.

## Why It Interests Me

The idea of nurturing a virtual pet sparks fond memories of early handheld games like Tamagotchi. It evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminding me of the joy and responsibility of caring for a digital companion. I am excited about the opportunity to recreate that emotional connection and playful experience while introducing fresh challenges and features. This project not only pays homage to cherished childhood memories but also explores how contemporary gaming can enhance storytelling and interaction, bridging the gap between the past and present.
